### Name Rules
# 1. No spaces (minutes in year does not work)
# 2. Only . and _ are acceptable punctuation (minutes.in.year and minutes_in_year and minutesinyear will all work and are all different names).
# 3. Names cannot begin with a punctuation mark.
# 4. Names can contain numbers, but cannot start with a number (2times5 does not work, but prod_2_5 will work)
